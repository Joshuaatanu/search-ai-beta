# Email Setup Instructions for Password Reset Functionality

## Configuration Steps

1. Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
# Email Configuration (required for password reset)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
```

2. **IMPORTANT**: For Gmail, you need to use an App Password, not your regular password:
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
   - Create a new app password for "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Use the generated 16-character password as your MAIL_PASSWORD

3. Make sure your email provider allows SMTP access:
   - Gmail requires App Passwords if you have 2FA enabled
   - Some providers may require you to explicitly allow less secure apps

4. Test the password reset functionality after configuring these settings.

## Troubleshooting

- If emails aren't being sent, check your Flask application logs for SMTP errors
- Verify that your email credentials are correct
- Some email providers may block automated emails - check your email provider's spam policies
- Make sure your server's IP isn't blacklisted by email providers
